## Options

Besides property Name and Type all other forms definitions use attributes to set configurations values and options.
Every property is considered a field in the form schema.

Some attributes are provided by this tool see [Custom Attributes](custom-attributes.md) and some are considered to extract metadata see [Attribues](attributes.md)
